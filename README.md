# Spacey-Shoot
CS425 Final Project
CS425 final project proposal

Team members: Max Martin

Game name: Spacy Shoot


1.	Provide an overview of your game (give a short description about the game, i.e., core mechanics, game plot, objective, etc.): 

The player flies a spaceship on a 2-D plane, navigating different sectors (levels), and shooting enemies to collect scrap (points) with the ultimate goal of finding and defeating the boss enemy.


2.	What will be the main technical components (game AI, motion planning, physics, procedural content generation) that your game will focus on? 

The main technical component will be the physics of the ships flying through space as well as the AI of the enemies. The sectors could also be generated procedurally if I have time.


3.	What game engine/tools/libraries will your game use?

The game will primarily use elements from the game engine used in the CS425 projects.



4.	Why do you think your game is interesting/exciting? 

The game will be engaging because of the skill-based flying and shooting as well as the goal driven progression.



5.	How would you divide the tasks among your team members (if more than one)? 

Its just me.
